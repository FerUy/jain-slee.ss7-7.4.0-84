.Mobility - Location Management Service events
[cols="1,1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Event Class | Comments
| INITIAL_DP_REQUEST | InitialDPRequest | The SSF will send InitialDPRequest to SCF to start CAMEL service.
| ACTIVITY_TEST_REQUEST | ActivityTestRequest | The activity test (AT) is used for testing the CAMEL dialogue between the gsmSCF and the gsmSSF. The SCP may send CAP AT at regular intervals to the gsmSSF, e.g. every 15 min. The only function of CAP AT is to verify the existence of the CAMEL dialogue. When the gsmSSF receives CAP AT, it returns an empty RESULT to the gsmSCF. If the gsmSCF does not receive an operation RESULT within the operation time for CAP AT, e.g. 5 s, then the gsmSCF terminates the CAMEL service. CAP AT is normally sent by the SCP platform, not by the CAMEL service. The arrival of CAP AT in the gsmSSF has no impact on any call handling process or on the BCSM. The sending of CAP AT is not dependent on the phase of the call or on the gsmSSF FSM state
| ACTIVITY_TEST_RESPONSE | ActivityTestResponse | Response to ActivityTestRequest
| APPLY_CHARGING_ REPORT_REQUEST | ApplyChargingReportRequest | This is the report that is sent from gsmSSF to gsmSCF at the end of a call period or when the call is released. In addition, when call set up failure occurs, such as called party busy or no answer, the gsmSSF also sends a charging report (if previously requested).
| APPLY_CHARGING_REQUEST | ApplyChargingRequest | This is the instruction from the gsmSCF to the gsmSSF to start or continue monitoring the call duration.
| ASSIST_REQUEST_ INSTRUCTIONS_REQUEST | AssistRequest InstructionsRequest | Used by assisting gsmSSF to start the assisting dialogue.
| CALL_INFORMATION_ REPORT_REQUEST | CallInformationReportRequest | This event contains the call-related information that was previously requested for this call.
| CALL_INFORMATION_ REQUEST_REQUEST | CallInformationRequestRequest | This operation is used to request call-related information.
| CANCEL_REQUEST | CancelRequest | This event has a dual purpose:

* It may be used to disarm armed detection points and to cancel requests for reports. It is normally used when a CAMEL service wants to terminate the relationship

* It may be used to prevent or stop the execution of a user interaction operation, which was previously sent to the gsmSRF or to the intelligent peripheral.

| CONNECT_REQUEST | ConnectRequest | This event is used to instruct the gsmSSF to continue call establishment with modified information. This operation may also be used to generate a follow-on call.
| CONNECT_TO_ RESOURCE_REQUEST | ConnectToResourceRequest | This event is used to instruct the gsmSSF or assisting gsmSSF to connect the call to a specialized resource, for user interaction
| CONTINUE_REQUEST | ContinueRequest | This operation is used to instruct the gsmSSF to continue call processing at the DP where call processing was suspended
| DISCONNECT_FORWARD_ CONNECTION_REQUEST | DisconnectForward ConnectionRequest | This operation is used to terminate the connection to a specialized resource or to terminate a temporary connection to an assisting gsmSSF or intelligent peripheral
| ESTABLISH_TEMPORARY_ CONNECTION_REQUEST | EstablishTemporary ConnectionRequest | This event is used to establish a temporary connection between the serving (G)MSC and an MSC with assisting gsmSSF
| EVENT_REPORT_BCSM_REQUEST | EventReportBCSMRequest | This event is used by the gsmSSF to inform the gsmSCF about the occurrence of an event
| FURNISH_CHARGING_ INFORMATION_REQUEST | FurnishChargingInformationRequest | The gsmSCF may use this operation to place service-specific data in the CDR for the call
| PLAY_ANNOUNCEMENT_REQUEST | PlayAnnouncementRequest | A CAMEL service may use this operation to instruct the gsmSRF or intelligent peripheral to play an announcement
| RELEASE_CALL_REQUEST | ReleaseCallRequest | This operation is used by the gsmSCF to release a call
| PROMPT_AND_COLLECT_ USER_INFORMATION_REQUEST | PromptAndCollectUser InformationRequest | A CAMEL service may use this operation to instruct the gsmSRF or intelligent peripheral to play an announcement and to collect digits from the user
| PROMPT_AND_COLLECT_ USER_INFORMATION_RESPONSE | PromptAndCollectUser InformationResponse | Response to PromptAndCollectUser InformationRequest
| REQUEST_REPORT_BCSM_ EVENT_REQUEST | RequestReportBCSM EventRequest | This operation may be used by the gsmSCF to arm or disarm detection points in the BCSM
| RESET_TIMER_REQUEST | ResetTimerRequest | This operation may be used by the gsmSCF to reload and restart the Tssf timer
| SEND_CHARGING_ INFORMATION_REQUEST | SendChargingInformationRequest | This operation may be used by the gsmSCF to send advice of charge information to the served subscriber
| SPECIALIZED_RESOURCE_ REPORT_REQUEST | SpecializedResourceReportRequest | This operation is used by the gsmSRF to inform the gsmSCF that the playing of an announcement is complete
